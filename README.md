<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
<p align="center">
I started this framework because of realisation that SFML is not enough to write a game, because you need architecture.
That's the only one reason i deicided to write this framework, also i think there is only one user - me. I write it mainly for my own purposes,
it would be a pleasure to find someone else who finds this project useful for game development.
</p>
<br>
<p>
This framework is made of 2 parts: core and framework itself. These parts are namepspaces actually and they contains really different things.
Core is just an overwrapper of SDL libraries, but Framework contains all classes related to game architecture( or my vision of architecture).
</p>

### Built With
- ```SDL2```
- ```SDL_TTF```(optional)
- ```SDL_IMG```(optional)

### Projects that used Goat2d
- <a href="https://github.com/MAGANER/Goat2d">Colored 2048</a>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Installation

<h4>On your own</h4>
<p>
To build framework on your own, you need to get SDL2 and additional libraries for images, ttf, audio if you use them.
To get all information about these libraries follow <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2's official site</a>. Or you 
can follow <a href="https://www.lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php">Lazy Foo's tutorials</a> to find out how to build all required libraries.
After SDL2 and all related libraries are built you should correctly link them to your project with Goat2d or you can statically build goat2d with
all libraries.
</p>

<h4>With install.py</h4>
<p>
Following this way, you should clone this repo first and then run install.py. To properly run this script cmake and unzip applications are required.
You can use this script to get SDL and all additional libraries. Then you just need to build SDL main library after you get makefiles/visual studio project/e.t.c.
After installation you can build Goat2D as static or dynamic library.
 
</p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES 
### Usage
<h4 align="center">Creation of window</h4>
```c++
